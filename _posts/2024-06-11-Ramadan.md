During the 9th month of the Islamic calendar, over 1 billion people fast and celebrate an ancient tradition known as Ramadan. During Ramadan, Muslims are prohibited from eating and drinking during the day and must also do kind things for the disadvantaged. After dusk, and before dawn however, families come together and eat special big meals to give them energy to last the rest of the day. Here, we’ll talk about it’s origins, when it occurs, who celebrates it, and what you should know if you’re traveling during this sacred month.
## The History
In the religion of Islam, it is believed that during the 9th month in 610, the angel named ‘Gabriel’ came to Prophet Muhammad and revealed to him the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam. This also included the 5 pillars of Islam that all Muslims follow now, which also contained fasting during Ramadan. During Ramadan, it is a time where Muslims aim to build stronger connection with Allah, and also growing spiritually.
## Who Celebrates it?
> A common misconception is that Muslim and Islam are two different religions, however this is not true. Islam is the religion, and a Muslim is a follower of Islam. Same as calling someone who follows Christianity a 'Christian'.

Because fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars that all Muslims follow, all Muslims should fast during this time to keep following the Religion of Islam, as denying any of the 5 pillars in the religion is seen as directly rejecting the commands of God. However, with the celebration of Ramadan, there are some exceptions. People who are:
- Of old age 
- Pregnant 
- Sick 
- Financially disadvantaged 
- Children how have not hit puberty yet

Are pardoned from fasting, however most children do still practice fasting, and also still participate in celebrations and family meals.
## Dates
It is stated that Ramadan occurs on the 9th month. However, this is not September. This is instead referring to the Islamic calendar, which follows the cycles of the moon. Because of this, Ramadan occurs on a slightly different every year. For reference, Ramadan in 2024 occurred between the `11th of March` and the `9th of April`. Adding on to this, at the end of Ramadan, a massive celebration takes place known as Eid al-Fitr, which means ‘the festival of breaking the fast’. Eid is one of the two main festivals marked in Muslim’s calendars.
## Why do people celebrate it?
Stated earlier on, Ramadan is a time to grow spiritually, and gain closer connection to their god Allah and their loved ones. This means they abstain from eating and other pleasurable activities such as smoking, the consumption of alcohol, and sexual intercourse. It can also be a test to step into other people’s shoes that aren’t as fortunate as others.
## Ramadan in Indonesia
Indonesia is a very popular international tourist attraction, especially for Aussies. And due to the population being predominately Islamic, a lot goes on in Indonesia during the sacred period. During Ramadan, street vendors will start selling lanterns called a 'fanoos'. These lanterns symbolise Allah, and the light that they bestowed open us. Muslims also like to start making these months before Ramadan, due to the massive demand for them.

Indonesians also like to greet the month in a very festive manner. One very simple thing you might see on your journey is kids playing around with firecrackers or fireworks. In Bali and West Java, families also like to come together and apologise for any wrong doings that happens amongst them. Another family related tradition is visiting passed relatives at their resting place.

With Indonesia's famous hustle and bustle, Muslims prefer to celebrate Ramadan in Indonesia, as they have easier access to breaking fast meals out on the streets. Here's some images.

### So, what should I expect?
Well, due to most of Indonesia fasting, alot of food and drink places will be closed, especially the further away you get from popular tourist destinations. However, big chains such as Macca's most likely wont be affected.
